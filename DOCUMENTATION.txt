DATABASE SCHEMA

users table:
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)

items table:
CREATE TABLE items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY(user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
)

INSTALLATION

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

Setup steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd flask-app

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
   python app.py

The app will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

USAGE GUIDE

Authentication:
1. Create a new account using the Sign Up form
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Access the dashboard and navigate using the sidebar

Dashboard:
View statistics and recent items at a glance.

Items Section:
- Add new items with title and description
- View all your items in a grid layout
- Delete items when no longer needed
- Items display creation date

Settings:
- Change your password securely
- Requires current password verification
- New password must be at least 6 characters
- Passwords must match to update

Admin Panel:
Manage users in the system:
- Create new users with username and password
- View all users and their creation dates
- Delete users from the system (cannot delete current user)
- Username must be at least 3 characters
- Password must be at least 6 characters

API ROUTES

Authentication Routes:
GET/POST /login - User login page and authentication
GET/POST /signup - User registration page and account creation
GET /logout - User logout

Main Application Routes:
GET / - Redirect to login page
GET /dashboard - Dashboard view with statistics
GET /items - View all user items
POST /items - Add new item
POST /delete-item/<item_id> - Delete specific item
GET /settings - Settings page
POST /settings - Change password
GET /admin - Admin panel view
POST /admin/add-user - Create new user
POST /admin/delete-user/<user_id> - Delete user

SECURITY NOTES

- Passwords are hashed using SHA256
- All routes are protected with session checks
- Database uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Session management prevents unauthorized access
- Change the secret key in production: Update app.secret_key in app.py
- Cannot delete currently logged-in user from admin panel
- Items are linked to user_id for data isolation

DESIGN FEATURES

Color Scheme:
Primary: #141313 (dark background)
Accent: #FFE4C4 (bisque)
Secondary: #FF6464 (error red)
Success: #64FF64 (success green)

Design Patterns:
- Glassmorphism with backdrop blur effects
- Smooth fade-in and slide animations
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Dark theme optimized for extended viewing
- Consistent spacing and typography

Responsive Design:
- Desktop: Full sidebar layout (250px fixed)

- Mobile: Stacked navigation, single-column forms

VALIDATION RULES

Username:
- Minimum 3 characters required
- Must be unique in the system
- Used for login and identification

Password:
- Minimum 6 characters required
- SHA256 hashing for secure storage
- Password confirmation required during signup
- Current password verification required for changes

Items:

TROUBLESHOOTING

Database Issues:
Problem: "database locked" error
Solution: Close other connections to the database, restart the app

Problem: Database not initializing
Solution: Delete users.db file, restart app to recreate

Session Problems:
Problem: Logged out unexpectedly
Solution: Browser session may have expired, log in again

Problem: Cannot access protected pages
Solution: Ensure you are logged in, check if session cookie is enabled

Password Issues:
Problem: Cannot change password
Solution: Verify current password is correct

Problem: "Passwords do not match"
Solution: Ensure new password and confirm password are identical

Navigation Issues:
Problem: Sidebar not appearing
Solution: Ensure you are logged in; sidebar only shows for authenticated users

DEVELOPMENT TIPS

Debug Mode:
- App runs with debug=True by default
- Changes to code auto-reload
- Error pages show detailed stack traces

Database Inspection:
- Use SQLite Browser tools to view database
- Check users table for account data
- Check items table for content

Log Monitoring:
- Flask logs appear in terminal
- SQL errors will display in console
- Failed requests show detailed messages

Testing:
- Create test accounts for features
- Test password change functionality
- Verify item deletion
- Test admin user creation and deletion

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT

For production use, make these changes:

1. Security:
   - Change app.secret_key to a strong random string
   - Set debug=False in app.py
   - Use HTTPS for all connections
   - Implement CSRF protection

2. Database:
   - Use connection pooling for multiple requests
   - Set up automated backups
   - Consider database migration tools

3. Hosting:
   - Use production WSGI server (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
   - Set environment variables for configuration
   - Use reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache)
   - Implement load balancing if needed

4. Authentication:
   - Consider using bcrypt instead of SHA256
   - Implement password reset functionality
   - Add rate limiting to login/signup
   - Add email verification for accounts

5. Monitoring:
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry)
   - Monitor application performance
   - Log all important events
   - Set up alerts for errors

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

General Tips:
- Database indexes on frequently queried columns
- CSS minification for production
- Static file caching with browser cache headers
- Lazy loading for item lists

Database Optimization:
- Add indexes on user_id and username
- Use EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN for slow queries
- Archive old items periodically
- Consider pagination for large item lists

Frontend Optimization:
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript
- Compress images and assets
- Use CDN for static files
- Implement lazy loading

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Planned Features:
- Email verification for signup
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- User profile customization
- Item sharing between users
- Activity logging and audit trail
- Backup and restore functionality
- REST API documentation
- Role-based access control

Improvements:
- Search functionality for items
- Item categorization and tagging
- Item filtering and sorting
- User preferences/settings
- Dashboard charts and analytics
- Batch operations on items
- Export data functionality

TROUBLESHOOTING ADVANCED

Application Won't Start:
1. Check Python version: python --version
2. Verify Flask installation: pip show Flask
3. Check for port conflicts: Port 5000 might be in use
4. Solution: Change port in app.py: app.run(port=5001)

Database Corruption:
1. Backup current database
2. Delete users.db
3. Restart application
4. Recreate user accounts

Memory Issues:
1. Check for connection leaks in database code
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Restart Python application
4. Monitor system resources

Performance Slowness:
1. Check database query performance
2. Review large item lists (add pagination)
3. Monitor network requests
4. Check for CSS animation performance

SESSION AND COOKIES

Session Management:
- Session data stored server-side
- Session ID stored in browser cookie
- Default session timeout: browser close
- Session key: app.secret_key

Cookie Settings:
- Secure flag should be set in production
- HttpOnly flag enabled by default
- SameSite policy recommended
- Clear cookies when logging out
